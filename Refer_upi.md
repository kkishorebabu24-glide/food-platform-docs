The iamrobinsharaya/upipay <https://github.com/iamrobinsharaya/upipay>
repository is a TypeScript-based open-source SDK designed to wrap official PhonePe Business and Paytm Business merchant APIs. It provides developers with a self-hosted, 0% commission UPI gateway solution to completely bypass third-party aggregators. [1]
A "Cyber Factory Check" (a thorough security architectural and code review) of this implementation highlights several critical design patterns, hidden operational risks, and vulnerability vectors you must consider before putting it into a production environment:
------------------------------

## 🔎 Architectural Strengths

*
* Zero Aggregator Intermediation: By acting as a pure code wrapper around business APIs, it prevents data exposure to middle-tier aggregators. [1]
* Native Protocol Adherence: It interfaces directly with native merchant protocols rather than relying on brittle HTML scraping or Android notification interception. [1]
*

------------------------------

## ⚠️ Critical Security Risk & Vulnerability Factors## 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Webhooks

Because this SDK processes payment status check requests and handles callback/webhook parameters from Paytm and PhonePe, it is highly susceptible to SSRF if inputs are not sanitized.

*
* The Risk: An attacker could spoof the webhook origin or pass external callback domains, forcing your server to fire internal HTTP requests to your local network infrastructure.
* Mitigation: You must rigidly enforce strict IP allowlisting (ingress filtering) for known PhonePe and Paytm server CIDR blocks.
*

## 2. Signature Replay & Weak Verification

When bypassing a full-scale aggregator platform, the burden of verifying transaction integrity falls entirely on your implementation of this SDK.

*
* The Risk: If your server fails to stringently validate the checksum headers (X-VERIFY) using your merchant salt key, malicious actors can replay old, successful transaction payloads to mark new orders as "Paid".
* Mitigation: Enforce strict cryptographic validation on every status payload and ensure transaction IDs are tied to a strict, single-use server state (Idempotency).
*

## 3. Client-Side Secrets Leakage

A common mistake when developers integrate direct-to-bank UPI libraries is compiling the initialization logic into front-end code.

*
* The Risk: Bundling this SDK inside a frontend React/Next.js client instead of a secure backend Node.js environment exposes your Merchant ID, Salt Key, and Salt Index.
* Mitigation: Keep the library strictly isolated within your backend code. Expose only ephemerally generated transaction URLs or payload hashes to your frontend client.
*

## 4. The "Race Condition" Status Loop Vulnerability

Unlike heavy aggregators that feature automated webhook queuing with exponential backoff, lightweight SDK wrappers rely on manual cron checking or raw polling.

*
* The Risk: If a user cancels a transaction or closes the payment window, a poorly handled polling loop can cause database row locks, or open the door for race conditions where a payment status is updated out of sync.
* Mitigation: Implement strict database transactions (e.g., SELECT FOR UPDATE) when modifying an order's payment status based on the SDK's response.

## 📊 Comparative Analysis: Custom SDK vs. Traditional Gateway

| Security Feature | iamrobinsharaya/upipay SDK | Standard Aggregator (e.g., Razorpay) |
|---|---|---|
| Credential Storage | Self-hosted (High Risk if unencrypted) | Managed cloud HSM (Secure) |
| Transaction Fees | 0% Commission | 2% to 3% per transaction |
| Attack Surface | Dependent entirely on your app security | Handled by third-party infrastructure |
| Data Privacy | Absolute control over user payload | Shared with the vendor platform |

------------------------------
💡 The Verdict: The upipay implementation provides a brilliant financial advantage by eliminating merchant fees. However, it effectively shifts 100% of the compliance, encryption, and validation security burdens onto your engineering team. It is safe for production only if layered behind a secure backend API, protected by strict webhook signature validation, and monitored by server-side rate limits. [1]
If you would like to proceed with securing your setup, let me know:

*
* Will you be deploying this on a serverless architecture (like Vercel/AWS Lambda) or a dedicated server?
* Which specific merchant portal (PhonePe Business or Paytm Business) are you planning to leverage?
* Do you need an explicit Node.js middleware blueprint to safely verify incoming webhooks using this library? [1]

QnA: (as per the latest government or npci norms)
How many transactions will be supported for perticular merchant?
what are the limits for transaction and overall transaction limit in a day/month/year?
how the api works and what are all security guidelines shall be followed as per UPI?
