### Added

- **Chef Menu Management & Power Tools**:
  - Interactive **Edit Dish** dialog with pre-populated form state supporting name, category, pricing, portions, spice level, description, and photo updates via `PUT /api/v1/menus/{menu_id}`.
  - 1-Click **"Duplicate / Clone Dish"** button cloning active menu items into new drafts titled `Dish Name (Copy)`.
  - **Spice Level Indicator**: Database schema & Alembic migration `ea7fe3ab7835` adding `spice_level` (`mild`, `medium`, `hot`), displayed with badges (`🌶️ Mild`, `🌶️🌶️ Medium`, `🌶️🌶️🌶️ Hot`).
  - **Low Stock Urgency Badge**: Automated `⚠️ Only X portions left` indicators when inventory is between 1 and 3 portions.
  - **Local Device Photo Browsing**: Native file picker supporting `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.webp` with client-side 5MB size check, instant thumbnail previews, and upload to `/api/v1/menus/{id}/image`.
- **In-Flight Cart Concurrency & Real-Time Price Protection**:
  - Guard in `order_service.py` comparing cart item prices against current database prices at checkout.
  - Rejects transactions with HTTP 400 if prices differ by $> ₹0.01$, prompting buyers to review updated prices and preventing silent overcharging.
- **Automated Test Matrix Expansion**:
  - Added `seller-menu-edit.test.jsx` (Edit modal, clone workflow, spice badges, low stock alerts).
  - Added backend pytest cases for cart concurrency price guards and spice level CRUD in `test_orders.py`.
  - Backend test coverage reached **41/41 passing tests (100%)**; Frontend test coverage reached **27/27 passing tests across 11 test suites (100%)**.

### Fixed

- Resolved symptom where menu items were not rendering after creation due to `{ items: [...], total: N }` payload response parsing in `SellerDashboard.jsx`.
